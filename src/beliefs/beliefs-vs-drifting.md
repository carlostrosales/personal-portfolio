# you should have beliefs (vs. drifting without them)

## opening statement
I believe that you should have beliefs. Beliefs that you have molded as your own intentionally. Now I am not talking in the sense that they should be fixed and absolute, but you should have a good grasp on your beliefs across many areas if you were to be asked today. Without beliefs, you are simply drifting.

## why I hold this belief
Beliefs are the way in which we see the world. A lens if you will. They give shape to how you see the world around you and how you operate within life, work, leisure, and ultimately how you relate to others that you come across. It is not so much in finding beliefs that are deemed right, but in finding beliefs that align with how you "see" and how you hope to "see". This provides present day clarity, direction, and intentionality. It is about knowing where you stand, even if that may be temporarily.

## the opposite side
Now it can be argued that having set beliefs restrict you, and aren't freeing. Now I believe that could hold some truth, but very little, if any. As that can lead to passivity and being susceptible to others beliefs and convictions. 

## how it applies
In your professional career, having beliefs about engineering, design, product, and leadership makes yyou a force multipler for decision making and becoming action oriented. As it is more often than not the ones that have strong beliefs, are the exact ones who act upon those beliefs and push the envelope.In life, having beliefs about relationships, values, ethics, and curiosity make you intentional. They don't need to be highly articulated or even set in stone, but you should start somewhere.
